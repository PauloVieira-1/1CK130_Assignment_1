This approach is particularly useful for simulating systems such as supply chains, logistics networks, queueing systems, and industrial processes. The goal of this course is to teach you about modelling logistics networks and optimizing actions based on those models. DES is a key tool for implementing those models."

Note that the `__lt__` function is a \"dunder\" method where \"lt\" stands for \"less than\". By implementing this method, Python knows how to compare an event class with any other class that defines the time property. This comes in handy later on when we have to add events to a list while making sure that they are processed in the correct chronological order."

It is reasonable to believe that more bikes are rented during peak hours. To enable more realistic arrival patterns, we define the following function. It generates customer arrivals following an inhomogeneous Poisson process, i.e., interarrival times are exponential, but the scale of the exponential distributions varies over the hours of the day."
