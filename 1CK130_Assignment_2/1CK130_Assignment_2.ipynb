Assess the overall service level of the network under this approach. In addition, analyze at what locations stockouts mainly occur and present your findings with a nice visualization.\n",

        "*   You probably need an `FutureEventSet` class as well as a `CustomerArrivalEvent` and a `BikeReturnEvent`. Note that both events now also need an attribute `location` that refers to the location where the bike is withdrawn from or returned. This `location` is a number between `0`and `19` (since we have 20 locations). At the beginning of a day, you can \"fill\" the FES by generating hourly arrivals for each location. Check in Assignment 1 which function could be useful here.\n",
        "*   It would be wise to encapsulate your simulation in a function that takes the initial bike distribution as an input to allow you to easily compare different distributions. Given that there is some stochasticity in the simulation, it is important to do a number of replications, to avoid randomness from impacting the outcomes too much. It may also be beneficial to control the randomness by controlling the seed, so that different bike distributions are evaluated using the same demand sequences.\n",
